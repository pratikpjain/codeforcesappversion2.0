# Hello Friends, 
### I have created a simple android application named <a href = "https://www.amazon.in/dp/B095CX7BNR/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_glt_fabc_TXMNKE85TK3D6KE6QJA3">CFProfile</a>.
### This app simply takes Codeforces 'Handle' as a input and displays all the profile details with submissions etc.
### You can have a quick look over <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-xl-xIZVd6eo0iTopjgs1xf1wfGlRvx/view?usp=sharing" target = _blank>video</a> to know how it works.
### You can also refer <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J9Y9oUcCp3WzyO1ypYGlFhhHyoWCjFW0-XYPnjTGdgQ/edit?usp=sharing">directions.doc</a> file to know working.
### This app can actually help to those who practice cp on codeforces to know statistics of submissions.
### To create this app I had used <a href = "https://codeforces.com/apiHelp" target = _blank>codeforces api's</a> to fetch the information of a particular handle.
### Tools used to create the app:
### <ol>
<li>Platform: <a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio" target = _blank>Android Studio</a></li><br>
<li>Backend-Lang: <a href = "https://developer.android.com/kotlin?gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=CjwKCAjwy42FBhB2EiwAJY0yQs3o8U-t9sR2gml9jNy1vScWUfl2eVlwOc-3SNpPzOeMRr4txjLwhRoCfoMQAvD_BwE" target = _blank>Kotlin</a></li><br>
<li>Api's- <a href = "https://codeforces.com/apiHelp" target = _blank>Codeforces API</a></li><br>
